- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Python, C++, databases, AI and automation algorithms for repetitive tasks from Excel to different tasks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and basic electronics, although I want to expand to microcontrollers and on the other hand to the production and storage of renewable energies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the creation of mathematical algorithms and challenges towards my electrical technical knowledge.
